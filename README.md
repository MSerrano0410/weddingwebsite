# weddingwebsite
A website I created for my upcoming wedding. It's the largest showcase of my Javascript expertise that I have -- I use jQuery heavily as well as the Google Maps API.
To do:
  - add RSVP capabilities to website
  - add mobile-friendly version of the website*
    *This website works well on mobile devices, but the actual display isn't optimized for mobile.
  - add an Itinerary page
  - add Spanish version of the website

This website was done primarily using HTML5 (a mix of some HTML4 and HTML5 elements), CSS3, Javascript (mostly jQuery, 
but also some straight Javascript and the Google Maps API), and a little PHP thrown in for the email form. 
The HTML5 elements include the following:
    - a fieldset and legend for the Contact form
    - Most of the script and link tags don't have a "type" associated with them.
    - The doctype is the new HTML5-compatible shorthand i.e. DOCTYPE html.

I plan to incorporate some AngularJS for its template capabilities as well. Also, I plan to incorporate more HTML5 into the
website as time goes on.
